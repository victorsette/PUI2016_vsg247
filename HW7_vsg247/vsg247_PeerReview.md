## Peer review

The purpose of the present peer review is to assess the material submitted by Victor Sette Gripp (vsg247) as part of the Principles of Urban Informatics coursework. Throughout the mentioned exercise, I will perform a three-part evaluation of the student’s visualization assignment. The plot’s **clarity** will be determined by its accessibility component (a clear plot would display unambiguous quantities); the **esthetics** will be linked to the student’s choice of colors and graphical elements (how functional and communicative are those elements?), and the **honesty** criteria will be connected to the lack of intentional data deformation by the plot creator (is the data being reproduced in a transparent way?).

For the visualization assignment, Victor chose to plot World Bank-country indicators data and specifically, carbon emissions per capita and per GDP for the year 2010. After a notable data wrangling process, Victor was able to merge only needed information (<code>CO<sub>2</sub></code> emissions per capita in metric tons and <code>CO<sub>2</sub></code> emitted per GDP in kg / PPP US$) for the selected time period. The resulting plot clearly communicates Victor’s intention to establish a correlation between gas emissions and GDP by utilizing a double scale on the Y axis (.twinx). By implementing this graphical element as well as by using different colors for the two variables, the plot successfully displays the data and allows us to focus our attention on the positive correlation. 

Victor’s plot displays information on an unambiguous way and both his color choices and utilization of graphical elements positively affect our ability to perceive the correlation between carbon emissions and GDP. There is no sign of data deformation as he carefully dropped not needed values and chose PPP for analyzing GDP quantities (this choice is crucial to understand GPD as it involves relative costs of local goods instead of only displaying nominal values).

The only observation is related to the Notebook tittle. The data is not showing all greenhouse emissions; it is only displaying <code>CO<sub>2</sub></code> emissions and GDP values.
