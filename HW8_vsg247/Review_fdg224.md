# Figure 1
The plot shows, for the *C line*, the rush hour period, every 15 minutes (morning has peek around 9 am and evening around 6 pm) and the mean's trip for every station during the morning and evening rush hours (from 8 to 9:30 am and from 5 to 6:30 pm). While during the morning the terminal stations have more activity (**Retiro** and **Constitución**), the evening period shows more activity in the 4 stations closest to **Retiro**. The *C line* doesn't have a radial design, which connect city center with the most peripheral neighborhoods, but rather a circumferential one, crosing the other subway lines.**Retiro** and **Constitución** are also the interurban train stations, connecting with the North and the South, respectively, of the Greater Buenos Aires (the first is has overall better socioeconomic indicators).

**Review:**

- Clarity:


The "around the clock" plot is an interesting way to present the time dependence and can be effective depending on the intended to be communicated, but it also introduces some visual distortions that make the data a more difficult to read. For instance, it is hard to visualize how steep is the peak at the rush hour. It is also not easy to identify which were the interval limits of the rush hour considered for the breakdown plot by stations (although that information is presented at the caption). A possible way to make that visually more clear would be to make a circle representing the threshold considered for the rush hour definition.
Besides that, the variable name "trips' mean" is a little confusing for me. I understood that it was passenger counts for every 15 minutes interval, but from only looking at the plot I could not tell if what was being measured was people arriving or boarding at a given station. I would suggest a different name that would help to clarify that, such as "average number of boarding passengers" or something on those lines.


- Honesty:


The plot is honestly reproducing the data and not deforming it in order to emphasize any specific point.


- Esthetic:


The presentation was good and very understandable, but the plots were relatively small.
A possible way to improve the use of space would be to display a layout of 2x2 instead of 1x4. That way the morning x evening comparison could be maintained and the labels and title could be larger and easier to read. Besides that, another option to highlight the rush hours on the "around the clock" plot, instead of a threshold circle, would be to use a different color for that period, like red.
