The Figure above displays per capita water consumption in New York City from 1979 to 2009. According to the data there is a significant decrease in water consumption starting in the year 1991 (38% decrease)


**Review:**

- Clarity:


The plot is clear and has no distortions or ambiguities.


- Honesty:


The fact that the scale is not truncated and actually starts from zero makes the plot very honest and I believe it was the right choice in this case. 


- Esthetic:


The presentation was overall very understandable, but there are a couple of improvements that could be done: 


*Axes:* The axes' labels and numbers are a little too small, I would recommend increasing the font size of those elements. When doing that, it can be also a good idea to hide some of the year labels and show only multiples of 5 (1980, 1985, etc) or 2 (1980, 1982, etc), thus, getting rid of unnecessary visual distraction. Besides that, the label of the y axis would be more complete if it included “water consumption”, instead of only “per capita”, which could also be omitted since the unit already contains "per person". 
 
*Title:* The caption ID ("Figure 1") should actually not be in the plot title and rather in the beginning of the caption itself, and the font size could also be increased. As a suggestion, it could also be included in the title that data refers to New York City.


*Caption:* The caption seemed more like a piece of text referring to the plot instead of the actual caption that would anyway be below it. Therefore I would recommend to avoid expressions like “The Figure above displays”, or “According to the data”. Besides that, it should also start with the caption ID (“Figure 1”).
