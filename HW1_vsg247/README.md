# PUI 2016 HW1
I worked with many people in different moments. 
On Assingment 1, I worked with Danny (df1383), Avikal (as10724), Kristi (kk3374) and Yuan Shi (ys2808). We helped each other on figuring out the git commands, fixing merge conflicts, and messing with each other's repos.
On Assignment 2 we also worked in a big group and who helped me the most was Vishwajeet (vys217), especially on understanding the meaning of setting environmental variables (writing them into the .bashrc file) and on the commands to use the file editor (for this assignment I used vi).
The prints that resulted from this process were the following:

![Screenshot 2 Assignment 2: my sucssessful commands using $PUI2016 and the pui2016 alias] (/HW1_print02.png)

On Assignment 3 I worked with Danny (df1383) and we discussed the meaning and the correctness of our distributions and since I had started earlier I helped him find the multivariate function for the last part.
