### Assignment 1

For Assignment 1 we had to go through Dr. Sina Kashuk's notebook, on which we worked for the Lab class on Spatial Data Analysis, and reorganize it in order to make it more clear and compliant with our class rules. 

### Assignment 2

For Assignment 2 we re-did the analysis we had done in class but splitting the data into Summer and Winter. 
I separated the data considering Summer = May to October and Winter = November to April. 

The analysis led to the following conclusions:

The Summer and Winter spatial distributions were slightly different but no major changes in the spatial patterns could be identified. 
In the winter the spatial autocorrelation is a little stronger (Moran's I = 0.661) than in the summer (Moran's I = 0.646), but in both the significance level was pretty high (p-value = 0.001).
The number of hot and cold spots differed a bit from Summer to Winter. Which means that the number of individual census tracts that had ridership significantly correlated with its neighbors) changed a little from Summer to Winter. But in general the patterns were the same, showing no ridership where there are no bike stations (cold spots) and high ridership in South Manhattan, a little more concentrated in the west side.

### Group work

I worked alone for this Homework but I did compare results and discussed about their meaning with Daniel Fay (df1383) and Avikal Somvanshi (as10724)
