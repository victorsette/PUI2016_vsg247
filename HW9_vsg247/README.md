For the only assignment in this homework we worked data from the MTA about subway ridership in 600 different stations and for 23 different card types. 
We analyzed weekly ridership for a period of 194 weeks and did some time series analyses of three different types: event detection, identifying trends and identifying periodicity.

For this homework I worked mostly on my own but in many moments compared results and discussed the methodological issues with Daniel Fay (df1383) and Avikal Somvanshi (as10724).
