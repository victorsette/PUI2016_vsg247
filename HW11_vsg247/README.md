### Assignment 1

For Assignment 1 we trained a little bit how to handle spatial data, shape files, geoDataFrames e etc. 
We worked on a shape file of Brooklyn census tracts in order to find and plot the point corresponding to CUSP and to the census tract where it belongs. 

### Assignment 2

For Assignment 2 we did a lot of data munging in order to analyze data on the evolution of the number of businesses establishments from 1994 until 2014, per zipcode in New York City. 
For that we performed a clustering analysis on the zipcodes in order to investigate which of them had similar temporal patterns. 


### Group work

For this homework I worked a lot on my own, but did have some discussions with Avikal (as10724) and Felipe (fdg224), and in many moments through the data munging had some help from Hrafnkell (hh1713).
